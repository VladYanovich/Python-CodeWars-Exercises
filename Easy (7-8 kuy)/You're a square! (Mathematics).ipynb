    "You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes, you cant arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.\n",
